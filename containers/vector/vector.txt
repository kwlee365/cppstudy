- A vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic-size arrays, similar to list in Python
- Elements are stored in contiguous storage
- Supports random access to elements, i.e., direct access by their position index
- Offers efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the end
- Resizes automatically when elements are added beyound their capacity or removed.
